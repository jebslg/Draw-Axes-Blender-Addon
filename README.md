# Draw-Axes-Blender-Addon
Blender Addon that draws x, y and z axes with arrow, labels them and adds the objects to a separate collection. 

A menu option is added to the 3d View Object Menu.  Only one set of axes can be present at a time.

A variable at the beginning of the script allows the user to change the size of the axes.  The Z axis is shorter than the x and y axes. (This is specified in lines 75 and 79, and can easily be changed).
